<em>archive</em> that contains all the material required to <em>re-execute</em> it
in the same context.  That way, the command will be reproducible
everywhere, even on Linux systems that are supposed to be not
compatible with the original Linux system.  CARE is typically useful
to get reliable bug reports, demonstrations, <a href="http://www.artifact-eval.org">artifact evaluation</a>,
tutorials, portable applications, minimal rootfs, file-system
coverage, ...</p><p>By design, CARE does not record events at all.  Instead, it archives
environment variables and accessed file-system components -- before
modification -- during the so-called <em>initial</em> execution.  Then, to
reproduce this execution, the <tt>re-execute.sh</tt> script embedded into
the archive restores the environment variables and relaunches the
command confined into the saved file-system.  That way, both <em>initial</em>
and <em>reproduced</em> executions should produce the same results as they
use the same context, assuming they do not rely on external events --
like key strokes or network packets -- or that these external events
are replayed manually or automatically, using <a href="https://github.com/martinpitt/umockdev">umockdev</a> for instance.
That means it is possible to alter explicitly the reproduced
executions by changing content of the saved file-system, or by
replaying different external events.</p><div class="section" id="privacy"><h3>Privacy</h3><p>To ensure that no sensitive file can possibly leak into the archive,
CARE <em>conceals</em> recursively the content of <tt>$HOME</tt> and <tt>/tmp</tt>,
that is, they appear empty during the original execution.  Although,
for consistency reasons, the content of <tt>$PWD</tt> is <em>revealed</em> even if
it is nested into the two previous paths.</p><p>As a consequence, a program executed under CARE may behave
unexpectedly because a required path is not accessible anymore.  In
this case, such a path has to be revealed explicitly.  For details,
see the options <tt>--concealed-path</tt> and <tt>--revealed-path</tt>, and the
file <tt>concealed-accesses.txt</tt> as well.</p><p>It is advised to inspect the archived content before sharing it.</p></div></div><div xmlns="" class="section" id="example"><h2>Example</h2><p>In this example, Alice wants to report to Bob that the compilation of
PRoot v2.4 raises an unexpected warning:</p><pre>alice$ make -C PRoot-2.4/src/

make: Entering directory `PRoot-2.4/src'
[...]
CC    path/proc.o
./path/proc.c: In function 'readlink_proc':
./path/proc.c:132:3: warning: ignoring return value of 'strtol'
[...]</pre><p>Technically, Alice uses Ubuntu 11.04 for x86, whereas Bob uses
Slackware 13.37 on x86_64.  Both distros are supposed to be shipped
with GCC 4.5.2, however Bob is not able to reproduce this issue on his
system:</p><pre>bob$ make -C PRoot-2.4/src/

make: Entering directory `PRoot-2.4/src'
[...]
CC    path/proc.o
[...]</pre><p>Since they don't have much time to investigate this issue by iterating
between each other, they decide to use CARE.  First, Alice prepends
<tt>care</tt> to her command:</p><pre>alice$ care make -C PRoot-2.4/src/

care info: concealed path: $HOME
care info: concealed path: /tmp
care info: revealed path: $PWD
care info: ----------------------------------------------------------------------
make: Entering directory `PRoot-2.4/src'
[...]
CC    path/proc.o
./path/proc.c: In function 'readlink_proc':
./path/proc.c:132:3: warning: ignoring return value of 'strtol'
[...]
care info: ----------------------------------------------------------------------
care info: Hints:
care info:   - search for "conceal" in `care -h` if the execution didn't go as expected.
care info:   - use `./care-130213072430.bin` to extract the output archive.</pre><p>Then she sends the <tt>care-130213072430.bin</tt> file to Bob.  Now, he
should be able to reproduce her issue on his system:</p><pre>bob$ ./care-130213072430.bin
[...]
bob$ ./care-130213072430/re-execute.sh

make: Entering directory `PRoot-2.4/src'
[...]
CC    path/proc.o
./path/proc.c: In function 'readlink_proc':
./path/proc.c:132:3: warning: ignoring return value of 'strtol'
[...]</pre><p>So far so good!  This compiler warning doesn't make sense to Bob since
<tt>strtol</tt> is used there to check a string format; the return value is
useless, only the <tt>errno</tt> value matters.  Further investigations are
required, so Bob re-execute Alice's GCC differently to get more
details:</p><pre>bob$ ./care-130213072430/re-execute.sh gcc --version

gcc (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.5.2-8ubuntu4) 4.5.2
Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO

different:</p><pre>bob$ gcc --version

gcc (GCC) 4.5.2
Copyright (C) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</pre><p>This confirms that both GCC versions are the same, however Alice's one
seems to have been modified by Ubuntu.  Although, according to the web
page related to this Ubuntu package 
    [1]
  , no changes regarding
<tt>strtol</tt> were made.  So Bob decides to search into the files coming
from Alice's system, that is, the <tt>rootfs</tt> directory in the
archive:</p><pre>bob$ grep -wIrl strtol ./care-130213072430/rootfs

care-130213072430/rootfs/usr/include/inttypes.h
care-130213072430/rootfs/usr/include/stdlib.h
[...]</pre><p>Here, the file <tt>usr/include/stdlib.h</tt> contains a declaration of
<tt>strtol</tt> with the "warn unused result" attribute.  On Ubuntu, this
file belongs to the EGLIBC package, and its related web page 
    [2]
  
shows that this attribute was actually wrongly introduced by the
official EGLIBC developers.  Ultimately Bob should notify them in this
regard.</p><p>Thanks to CARE, Bob was able to reproduce the issue reported by Alice
without effort.  For investigations purpose, he was able to re-execute
programs differently and to search into the relevant files.</p><p>
