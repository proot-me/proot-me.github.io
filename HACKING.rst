-----------------------------------------------------------
An introduction to contributing to PRoot / CARE development
-----------------------------------------------------------

The PRoot Team welcomes, and depends, on contributions from students and
collaborators in the open source and academic communities.
Contributions can be made in a number of ways, a few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

Reporting an Issue
==================

Please include as much detail as you can. Let us know your host kernel
version, e.g, :code:`uname -a`, host/guest distribution, e.g. :code:`cat /etc/os-release`,
and the :code:`PRoot`/:code:`CARE` version number. If you get an error please include the full
error and/or traceback. Issues are tracked on GitHub at <https://github.com/proot-me/proot/issues>,
or can also be sent via  the `mailing list <mailto:proot_me@googlegroups.com>`_.

Submitting Pull Requests
========================

Once you are happy with your changes or you are ready for some feedback, push
it to your fork and send a pull request. For a change to be accepted it will
most likely need to have updated tests and/or documentation. New features
**require** additional tests in order to be included in a future release.
